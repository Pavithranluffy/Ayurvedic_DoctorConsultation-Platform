Scaling Plan for AyurCare Platform
This document outlines the strategy to scale the AyurCare platform to handle 5,000 appointments per day across 1,000 doctors.
1. API Design Principles
Stateless Services: All backend services will be stateless. User session information is stored in JWTs, allowing for horizontal scaling.
Asynchronous Operations: Non-critical tasks like notifications will use a message queue to prevent blocking the main request thread.
Efficient Payloads: All list endpoints will use pagination to optimize data transfer.
2. Database Schema & Performance
Indexing: We will add a composite index on (doctor_id, start_time) for fast availability lookups and single-column indexes on patient_id and status for dashboard filtering.
Read Replicas: One or more read replicas will be implemented for the PostgreSQL database. All read-heavy queries will be directed to these replicas, significantly reducing the load on the primary write database.
Connection Pooling: A robust connection pooler like PgBouncer will be used to manage database connections efficiently.
3. Slot-Locking & Concurrency
Distributed Locking with Redis: For high concurrency, the locking mechanism will be offloaded to Redis. This in-memory data store's atomic SETNX operation is much faster than database transactions, reducing contention at peak times.
4. Caching & Indexing Strategies
Redis for Caching: We will cache doctor profiles and doctor availability in Redis with short TTLs (e.g., 1-5 minutes). The cache for a doctor will be invalidated immediately after a booking or cancellation.
Content Delivery Network (CDN): A CDN will be used to cache static assets and public, infrequently changing API responses.
5. Horizontal Scaling Approach
Load Balancing: Multiple instances of the Node.js API server will be placed behind a load balancer to distribute traffic and improve throughput.
Containerization: The application will be packaged into Docker containers and managed with an orchestrator like Kubernetes to enable auto-scaling based on traffic.
6. Monitoring and Maintenance
Centralized Logging: A centralized logging service will be used to aggregate logs from all server instances for easy debugging.
Application Performance Monitoring (APM): An APM tool will monitor key metrics like API response times and error rates.
Automated Alerting: Alerts will be set up to notify the team of critical events, ensuring a proactive response to any issues.
